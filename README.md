# Windows-Memory-Digital-Forensics-Lab

## Overview
This lab provides hands-on experience with memory forensics to detect Dark Kittens malware in a compromised Windows system. Learn how to analyze memory dumps to identify malicious artifacts, processes, and network connections using industry-standard tools.

## Lab Scenario

Globomantics security team has detected unusual activity on one of their critical workstations. The system appears to be communicating with suspicious external IPs, but traditional antivirus tools haven't detected any malware. You've been called in to analyze a memory dump from the compromised machine to identify potential Dark Kittens malware, establish persistence mechanisms, and determine what data may have been exfiltrated.

## Prerequisites

- Windows or Linux or MacOS 
- Command Prompt (CMD) or Terminal with Admin/Sudo privileges
- At least 8GB RAM & 5 GB free disk space
- Internet connection for initial setup only
- Git installed (for cloning the repo)

## Learning Objectives

- Set up a memory forensics environment on Windows
- Use Volatility to analyze Windows memory dumps
- Identify suspicious processes, network connections, and malware artifacts
- Extract forensic evidence to determine attack vectors
- Document findings in a professional forensic report
