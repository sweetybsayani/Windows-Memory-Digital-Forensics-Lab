## Introduction

This Windows Memory Forensics Lab provides a simulated environment for security professionals and students to practice memory forensics techniques against a realistic attack scenario. The lab features the Dark Kittens threat group, a fictional APT targeting Globomantics' critical infrastructure.

Through a series of guided exercises, you'll learn to:
- Analyze memory dumps using forensic techniques
- Identify malicious processes and network connections
- Extract indicators of compromise
- Investigate persistence mechanisms
- Document findings in a professional forensic report

## Lab Scenario

Globomantics security team has detected unusual activity on one of their critical workstations. The system appears to be communicating with suspicious external IPs, but traditional antivirus tools haven't detected any malware. You've been called in to analyze a memory dump from the compromised machine to identify potential Dark Kittens malware, establish persistence mechanisms, and determine what data may have been exfiltrated.

## Prerequisites

- Windows or Linux or MacOS 
- Command Prompt (CMD) or Terminal with Admin/Sudo privileges
- At least 8GB RAM & 5 GB free disk space
- Internet connection for initial setup only
- Git installed (for cloning the repo)

## Learning Objectives

- Set up a memory forensics environment on Windows
- Use Volatility to analyze Windows memory dumps
- Identify suspicious processes, network connections, and malware artifacts
- Extract forensic evidence to determine attack vectors
- Document findings in a professional forensic report
